# The script consists of several steps:
# 1. define module keyword patterns, the designated label and assignee
# 2. define operating system keyword patterns, and the designated label
# 3. get the info about the issue
# 4. check if module keyword pattern matches text in the issue, 
#   looping over all patterns:
#   - if pattern is found, label the issue, and assign the maintainer
#   - if the pattern is not found, check if the label or assignee for the pattern
#     is attached to the issue and remove them
# 5. do 4 but with OS keyword patterns

# so far this workflow works best with the bug_template.
